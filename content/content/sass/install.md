# Install

## Install Anywhere (npm)

If you use Node.js, you can also install Sass using npm by running

```npm
npm install -g sass
```

However, please note that this will install the pure JavaScript implementation of Sass, which runs somewhat slower than the other options listed here. But it has the same interface, so itâ€™ll be easy to swap in another implementation later if you need a bit more speed!
Install on Windows (Chocolatey)

## If you use the Chocolatey package manager for Windows, you can install Dart Sass by running

```cmd
choco install sass
```

## Install on Mac OS X or Linux (Homebrew)

If you use the Homebrew package manager for Mac OS X or Linux, you can install Dart Sass by running

```shell
Install on Mac OS X or Linux (Homebrew)
